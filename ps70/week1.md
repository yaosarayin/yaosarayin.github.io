# Final Project ideas
<p>I had three ideas, but I decided that I really want to build a drone. I know it may not be as innovative as the others but I think I would learn a lot from the process and make it fly would be so amazing. I would love to learn the ins and outs of making it work and hopefully this can take my design and microcontroller coding skills to the next level. I am also very excited to build something that can actually fly. I think that would be very very satisfying.

I actually thought about the dronw idea because I live in the co-op which is a bit of a walk from campus. And I always forget to bring my lunch! So, I thought, wouldn't it be great to have a drone that can fly out of my window and bring me lunch? My friends who live off campus also always love coming to the coop for food but they do complain how cold and far the walk is sometimes. It would also be so awesome to have a drone that can deliver them some yummy food...

the details are still up for debate, but I found some nice resources online. Even though there are a lot of guidance, it still feels quite a challenging process. Especially trying to make it be able to hold up a tupperware...
